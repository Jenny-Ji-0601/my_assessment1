# What the project does
This project analyses regional disparities in access to electricity and clean fuels, using data from the World Bank (2021).
The dataset covers 264 regions between 1990 and 2019, tracking both temporal and cross-regional variations in energy accessibility.

The analysis includes data overview, data wrangling, data visualisation and interpretation. The project focuses on tracking yearly changes in electricity and clean fuel access rate, as well as differences between populations with and without access within each region. The project also focus on comparing average access rates across regions to highlight progress, development, and regional disparities.

This project is important because it can inform policymakers to design more evidence-based and targeted interventions to reduce global inequality.
